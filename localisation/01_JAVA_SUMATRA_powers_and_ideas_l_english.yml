Scholarly courts maintained Sanskrit and Pali libraries, while river-valley canals and roads boosted agriculture and troop movements. Rich gold and copper deposits funded temple projects and diplomatic gifts to Java and Champa. A Brahmin-led Narasari Council codified adat into law, stabilizing succession and tempering noble ambitions."

Annual balian-led trade fairs blended ritual and barter, strengthening social cohesion and placating ancestral spirits. Courts patronized Malay pantun poets whose verses preserved clan histories, while riverbank madrasas taught Quranic law alongside local customs."
