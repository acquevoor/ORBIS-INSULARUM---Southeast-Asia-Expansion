CHA_ideas:0 "Champa Ideas"
CHA_ideas_desc:0 "Champa, the maritime Hindu kingdom along Vietnam's central coast, flourished from the 2nd to the 15th centuries as a crossroads of Indian, Cham, and Chinese cultures. Its dynasts claimed divine descent, immortalizing their deeds in Sanskrit inscriptions and temple reliefs at Vijaya, My Son, and Po Nagar. Coastal fortresses and temple-complex bastions withstood repeated Khmer and Vietnamese assaults, while swift jongs launched seasonal raids on rival ports. A sophisticated mandala of vassal states paid tribute through elaborate rituals, weaving Champa's influence from the Mekong delta to the South China Sea. Exports of rice and aromatic woods underpinned both palace opulence and agrarian stability. Tales of the clever Mouse Deer (Teu) abound in Cham folklore - its cunning symbolizing the kingdom's resilience against larger foes."
