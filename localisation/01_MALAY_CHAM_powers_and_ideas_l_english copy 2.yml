JAR_ideas:0 "Jarai Ideas"
JAR_ideas_desc:0 "The Jarai of Vietnam’s Central Highlands trace their origins to Austronesian settlers who adapted to mountain forests over a millennium ago. Their society balanced swidden agriculture with expert forest crafts, producing rattan goods and resin that were traded to lowland markets. Spirit houses—small sacred dwellings at each longhouse entrance—anchor their complex cosmology, mediating between the living community and ancestral guardians in nightly rites. Matrilineal inheritance and clan councils ensured land and leadership passed through women, fostering social stability and swift decision-making. Seasonal swidden rotations maintained soil fertility and supported dense settlements without depleting the forest. Oral traditions and gong-accompanied epics preserved historical memory, reinforcing identity amid pressures from lowland kingdoms and colonial incursions."
