This is the GIT for Orbis Insularum mod project. 

For the contributors, make edit in your own branch and give it a trial run to make sure things actually work. Then open a pull request to merge it to main (or other specified branch depend on the edit made). 

Before your changes get added to main, someone (most likely Lunarac) needs to review and approve the PR to make sure everything is good.

Hopefully this will make the workflow better for everyone involved.

To all contributors, feel free to reach to Lunarac if there's any suggestions on how the process could be improved
