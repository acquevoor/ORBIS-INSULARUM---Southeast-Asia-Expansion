This is the GIT for Orbis Insularum mod project. 

For the contributors, make edit in your own branch and give it a trial run to make sure things actually work. Then open a pull request to merge it to main (or other specified branch depend on the edit made). 

Before your changes get added to main, someone (most likely Lunarac) needs to review and approve the PR to make sure everything is good.

Hopefully this will make the workflow better for everyone involved.

Pull the latest main branch to your local repo with git pull to stay up to date.
